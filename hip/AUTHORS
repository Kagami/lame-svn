  Added vorbisfile like interface.  Repackaged as seprate from lame. Python
  module.

- Leigh Smith <leighsmith@users.sourceforge.net>
  Added a patch:

Introduces two functions hip_decode_reset() and
hip_audiodata_precedesframes() to aid arbitrary seeking within
MP3 data. Standardised error messages to have a "hip:" prefix
(aiding error reporting by users of applications linking to hip) and
controlled the display of them using a #define HIP_DEBUG. Added
a couple of debugging fprintfs (controlled by HIP_DEBUG). Added
documentation of fields of struct frame and MPSTR.
