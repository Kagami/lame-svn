1.  replace termcap with ncurses.  ncurses works fine except 
for line-up cursor movement

2. 
When all sfb's have energy below ATH, (analog silence)
use a 32kbs frame even if min VBR bandwidth is larger.
(should be working -not thoroughly tested )

3.
User specified min & max bandwidth (scalefactor bands)
(Better: specify lowpass and highpass frequencies)

4.
Does stdin work when LAME is compiled to use libsndfile? 
(new version of libsndfile supports stdin - try this out)

5.
LAME uses a linear downsampling with simple lowpass filter
on the MDCT/polyphase coefficients.  Is this good enough, or
would a more expensive filter give better results?

6.
make use of subblock_gain (crude algorithm enabled with -Z) 
   One method:  loop over all possible subblock_gains and
   see which combination gives best distortion?  But this puts a lot
   of faith in the short block psycho acoustics

7.
make use of scalefactor_select  (crude algorithm enabled with -Y)

8.
10Hz high-pass filter.  Probably wont help much.


9. 
Modularization:

lame_parse_args():  main.c should parse the argument list, and then
call lame_setflags() or some other libmp3lame.a routine to 
set all the various flags.
