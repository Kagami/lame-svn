  <h1>The LAME Project</h1>
</div>

<p>LAME is an MPEG Audio Layer III (MP3) encoder licensed under the LGPL.</p>

<h3 id="latest_release">Latest LAME release: v3.96.1 (July 2004)</h3>

<p>LAME development started around mid-1998. Mike Cheng started it as a patch
against the 8hz-MP3 encoder sources. After some quality concerns raised by
others, he decided to start from scratch based on the dist10 sources. His goal
was only to speed up the dist10 sources, and leave its quality untouched. That
branch (a patch against the reference sources) became Lame 2.0, and only on Lame
3.81 did we replaced of all dist10 code, making LAME no more only a patch.</p>

<p>The project quickly became a team project. Mike Cheng eventually left
leadership and started working on tooLame, an MP2 encoder. Mark Taylor became
leader and started pursuing increased quality in addition to better speed. He
can be considered the initiator of the LAME project in its current form. He
released version 3.0 featuring gpsycho, a new psychoacoustic model he
developed.</p>

<p>In early 2003 Mark left project leadership, and since then the project has
been lead through the cooperation of the active developers (currently 4
individuals).</p>

<p>Today, LAME is considered the best MP3 encoder at mid-high bitrates and at
VBR, mostly thanks to the dedicated work of its developers and the open source
licensing model that allowed the project to tap into engineering resources from
all around the world. Both quality and speed improvements are still happening,
probably making LAME the only MP3 encoder still being actively developed.</p>
