Make sure you have lame3.04 or greater.&nbsp; there were some bugs in the
syncing of mp3x (the frame analyzer.)
<P>Find a sample with a noticeable artifact.&nbsp; testsignal2.wav is a
good example (see&nbsp; <A HREF="tests.html">tests.html</A> )&nbsp; LAME&nbsp;
will&nbsp; produce obvious and artificial "snare" like sounds that should
not be there.&nbsp;&nbsp; FhG sounds pretty good.&nbsp; If the FhG encoder
has the same problem, then good luck getting GPSYCHO to sound better than
FhG!
<P>Figure out what frame causes the problem.&nbsp; I use mpg123 for this.&nbsp;
For example,&nbsp; to play just 25 frames:&nbsp;&nbsp; "mpg123 -n 25&nbsp;
testsignal2.mp3".&nbsp; By trying different values for -n, you can usually
get a pretty good&nbsp; estimate of which frames are bad.
<P>For testsignal2.wav, the first problem is around frame 25.
<P>Look at the frames with mp3x ('lame -g', the graphical frame analyzer).&nbsp;&nbsp;
To get the frames from different encoders perfectly in sync with each other,
you need to compensate for the various delays introduced by the encoder.
<P>Encoders have different amounts of built in delay, meaning the mp3 file
will add extra padding to the
<BR>pcm data when it is decoded.&nbsp; All known decoders (including mpglib/mpg123
used by mp3x) also introduce their own delay, usually an additional 528
samples.&nbsp;&nbsp; So for the total amount of padding between the input
file and a decoded output file, add 528 to the numbers below.
<P>Encoder delays:
<P><TT>ISO models &amp; MPECKER:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 528 samples</TT>
<BR><TT>LAME 3.11 and earlier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 528 samples</TT>
<BR><TT>LAME 3.12-3.50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1160 samples</TT>
<BR><TT>LAME 3.54 and newer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 48
samples, adjustable - see ENCDELAY in encoder.h</TT>
<BR><TT>FhG mp3enc31:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1160 samples</TT>
<P>To use mp3x to do a direct frame by frame comparison between the various
encoders, you need to add padding to the input file so that the encoded
frames will be perfectly in sync.&nbsp; To add 632 bytes of padding to
your input file,
<BR>create a file "pad632.pcm" which just containes 4*632 bytes, all zero.&nbsp;
Then:
<UL>
<LI>
sox file.wav -t raw -x -w -s -c 2 -r 44100 temp.pcm</LI>

<LI>
cat pad632.pcm temp.pcm > temp2.pcm</LI>

<LI>
sox -t raw -x -w -s -c 2 -r 44100 temp2.pcm file632.wav</LI>

<LI>
l3enc -if file632.wav -of file632.mp3</LI>

<LI>
lame -g file632.mp3</LI>
</UL>
(note: the following frame numbers refered to LAME 3.11, and FhG applied
to the .wav file with 520 bytes of padding)
<P>For testsignal2.wav, you can see frame 25 (granule 1) and frame 26 (granule
0), LAME does not use short blocks and FhG does.&nbsp; For these frames,
the pe=1200.&nbsp; Forcing LAME to switch to short blocks for these (and
other similar frames) by setting switch_pe=1000 will produce a mp3 file
almost as good as the FhG.
<P>So why not just change pe_switch to 1000?&nbsp; It might be a good idea,
but then LAME will use about 2x as many short blocks as FhG.&nbsp; For
example, in <A HREF="tests.html">else3.wav, </A>frame 29 (granule=1), the
pe=1500, but FhG does not switch to short blocks.&nbsp; To compute the
total number of short blocks in a MP3, run mp3x out to the last frame and
then click on the "Stats" pull down menu.&nbsp; It will show a bunch of
statistics from the MP3 file.
<P>Note: the technique desribed above was used to tune some new window
switching algorithms now in LAME 3.10.&nbsp; These new tunings solve all
the problems mentioned above!
