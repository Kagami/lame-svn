<CENTER><H2>A Good Example For Tuning Pre-Echo Detection Criterion</H2></CENTER>

<HR>

<p>Make sure you have lame3.04 or greater. there were some bugs in the syncing of mp3x (the frame 
analyzer.)
</p>

<p>Find a sample with a noticeable artifact. testsignal2.wav is a good example (see <A HREF="tests.html">
tests.html</A>) LAME will produce obvious and artificial "snare" like sounds that should not be there.
FhG sounds pretty good. If the FhG encoder has the same problem, then good luck getting GPSYCHO to sound 
better than FhG!
</p>

<p>Figure out what frame causes the problem. I use mpg123 for this. For example, to play just 25 
frames: <tt>"mpg123 -n 25 testsignal2.mp3"</tt>. By trying different values for -n, you can usually
get a pretty good estimate of which frames are bad.
</p>

<p>For testsignal2.wav, the first problem is around frame 25.
</p>

<p>Look at the frames with mp3x ('lame -g', the graphical frame analyzer). To get the frames from 
different encoders perfectly in sync with each other, you need to compensate for the various delays 
introduced by the encoder.
</p>

<p>Encoders have different amounts of built in delay, meaning the mp3 file will add extra padding to the
pcm data when it is decoded. All known decoders (including mpglib/mpg123 used by mp3x) also introduce 
their own delay, usually an additional 528 samples. So for the total amount of padding between the input
file and a decoded output file, add 528 to the numbers below.
</p>

<p>Encoder delays:</p>

<pre>ISO models & MPECKER:     528 samples 
LAME 3.11 and earlier:    528 samples 
LAME 3.12-3.50           1160 samples 
LAME 3.54 and newer        48 samples, adjustable - see ENCDELAY in encoder.h 
FhG mp3enc31:            1160 samples</pre>

<p>To use mp3x to do a direct frame by frame comparison between the various encoders, you need to add 
padding to the input file so that the encoded frames will be perfectly in sync. To add 632 bytes of 
padding to your input file, create a file "pad632.pcm" which just containes 4*632 bytes, all zero. Then:
</p>

<UL>
	<LI>sox file.wav -t raw -x -w -s -c 2 -r 44100 temp.pcm</LI>
	<LI>cat pad632.pcm temp.pcm > temp2.pcm</LI>
	<LI>sox -t raw -x -w -s -c 2 -r 44100 temp2.pcm file632.wav</LI>
	<LI>l3enc -if file632.wav -of file632.mp3</LI>
	<LI>lame -g file632.mp3</LI>
</UL>

<p>(note: the following frame numbers refered to LAME 3.11, and FhG applied to the .wav file with 520 
bytes of padding)
</p>

<p>For testsignal2.wav, you can see frame 25 (granule 1) and frame 26 (granule 0), LAME does not use 
short blocks and FhG does. For these frames, the pe=1200. Forcing LAME to switch to short blocks for 
these (and other similar frames) by setting switch_pe=1000 will produce a mp3 file almost as good as 
the FhG.
</p>

<p>So why not just change pe_switch to 1000? It might be a good idea, but then LAME will use about 2x 
as many short blocks as FhG. For example, in <A HREF="tests.html">else3.wav</A>, frame 29 (granule=1), 
the pe=1500, but FhG does not switch to short blocks. To compute the total number of short blocks in a 
MP3, run mp3x out to the last frame and then click on the "Stats" pull down menu.It will show a bunch of
statistics from the MP3 file.
</p>

<p>Note: the technique described above was used to tune some new window switching algorithms now in 
LAME 3.10. These new tunings solve all the problems mentioned above!
