GPSYCHO outer_loop()&nbsp; algorithm</h1></center>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>Based on Bosi et al. "ISO/IEC MPEG-2 AAC", J. Audio Eng. Soc. 45 (1997)
p 789-814.
<p>Another good complement to the ISO documentation is:&nbsp; Brandenburg
&amp; Stoll, "ISO-MPEG-1 Audio: A Generic Standard for Coding of High-Quality
Digital Audio", J. Audio Eng. Soc 42 (1994) p 780-792.
<p>The goal of the outer_loop routine in MP3 is to find the combination
of scalefactors within each scalefactor band which produce the least amount
of audible distortion.&nbsp; Audible distortion is distortion in a scalefactor
band which exceeds the masking thresholds (computed by the psycho-acoustic
model)
<p>Pseudo-Code:
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><tt>initialize all scalefactors to 0.</tt>
<p><tt>compute initial q = quantization step size&nbsp; (bin_search_stepsize)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; divide &amp; conquer algorithm to find approximate
value of q</tt>
<p><tt>outer_loop:</tt>
<br><tt>do {</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; compute quantization with given scalefactors and not
too many bits</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; (call inner_loop)</tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; calc_noise():</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compute distortion within each scalefactor
band</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compare distortion to allowed distortion
(from psy-model)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over = number of scalefactor bands
where distortion > allowed_distortion</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tot_noise = average, over all bands
of distortion(db) - allowed_distortion(db)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over_noise= as tot_noise, but only
bands with distortion >&nbsp;allowed_distortion</tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; if this quantization is the best one found so far (determined
by quant_compare())</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; save it.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; if over=0 we are done, exit.</tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; amplify scalefactors for bands with distortion</tt>
<p><tt>} while over&lt;>0 or !(all scalefactors set to their max)</tt>
<p><tt>Restore BEST quantization</tt>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Whenever a scalefactor band is amplified, it will force the next quantization
to use more bits for that band.&nbsp; This will result in more bits used
to encode the MDCT coefficients in that band, and thus less quantization
error.&nbsp; That is why bands with audible distortion are amplified.&nbsp;
However, it will also result in less bits for the unamplified bands.&nbsp;
But these bands had a quantization error less than the allowed masking,
so hopefully they can tolerate a little more noise.&nbsp; The whole procedure
is designed to allocate the bits to the bands which need them the most.
<p>When the loop is done, if we found a quantization with count=0, everything
is great.&nbsp; Otherwise, we have to choose the best quantization that
we found.&nbsp; The ISO model chooses the last quantization tried during
outer_loop.&nbsp; This is strange because this is usually one of the worst.&nbsp;
The MPEG2 paper makes the obvious point that after trying out all the different
combinations, you should choose the BEST one, not the LAST one!&nbsp; GPSYCHO
defines the BEST quantization via the subroutine quant_compare(), and this
subroutine is in a constant state of flux!
<p>If you have ideas for a better way to define the BEST quantization,
let me know!
<p>Gabriel Bouvigne makes the following point:&nbsp;&nbsp; Which do you
think is worse:
<ul>
<li>
distortion only in band 9?&nbsp;&nbsp; (1.9-2.2kHz)&nbsp;&nbsp; (over =
1)</li>

<li>
distortion in band 0 (0-172Hz) and band 20 (13-16kHz)&nbsp; (over = 2)</li>
</ul>
The outer_loop() described above will choose the over=1 as the best quantization.
