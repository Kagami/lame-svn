GPSYCHO outer_loop()&nbsp; algorithm</H1></CENTER>

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<P>Based on Bosi et al. "ISO/IEC MPEG-2 AAC", J. Audio Eng. Soc. 45 (1997)
p 789-814.
<P>Another good complement to the ISO documentation is:&nbsp; Brandenburg
&amp; Stoll, "ISO-MPEG-1 Audio: A Generic Standard for Coding of High-Quality
Digital Audio", J. Audio Eng. Soc 42 (1994) p 780-792.
<P>The goal of the outer_loop routine in MP3 is to find the combination
of scalefactors within each scalefactor band which produce the least amount
of audible distortion.&nbsp; Audible distortion is distortion in a scalefactor
band which exceeds the masking thresholds (computed by the psycho-acoustic
model)
<P>Pseudo-Code:
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<P><TT>initialize all scalefactors to 0.</TT>
<P><TT>compute initial q = quantization step size&nbsp; (bin_search_stepsize)</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; divide &amp; conquer algorithm to find approximate
value of q</TT>
<P><TT>outer_loop:</TT>
<BR><TT>do {</TT>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; compute quantization with given scalefactors and not
too many bits</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; (call inner_loop)</TT>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; calc_noise():</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compute distortion within each scalefactor
band</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compare distortion to allowed distortion
(from psy-model)</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over = number of scalefactor bands
where distortion > allowed_distortion</TT>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; if this quantization is the best one found so far,
save it</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; if over=0 we are done, exit.</TT>
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise do ONE of the following (not both)</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turn pre-emphasis on</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amplify scalefactors for bands with
distortion</TT>
<P><TT>} while over&lt;>0 or !(all scalefactors set to their max)</TT>
<P><TT>Restore BEST quantization</TT>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Whenever a scalefactor band is amplified, it will force the next quantization
to use more bits for that band.&nbsp; This will result in more bits used
to encode the MDCT coefficients in that band, and thus less quantization
error.&nbsp; That is why bands with audible distortion are amplified.&nbsp;
However, it will also result in less bits for the unamplified bands.&nbsp;
But these bands had a quantization error less than the allowed masking,
so hopefully they can tolerate a little more noise.&nbsp; The whole procedure
is designed to allocate the bits to the bands which need them the most.
<P>When the loop is done, if we found a quantization with count=0, everything
is great.&nbsp; Otherwise, we have to choose the best quantization that
we found.&nbsp; The ISO model chooses the last quantization tried during
outer_loop.&nbsp; This is strange because this is usually one of the worst.&nbsp;
The MPEG2 paper makes the obvious point that after trying out all the different
combinations, you should choose the BEST one, not the LAST one!&nbsp; GPSYCHO
defines the BEST quantization as the one with the smallest value of "over".&nbsp;
Among quantizations with the same value of "over", LAME takes the one with
the largest scalefactors.&nbsp; This will be the quantization with the
best resolution in the bands where there is audible distortion.
<P>If you have ideas for a better way to define the BEST quantization,
let me know!
<P>Gabriel Bouvigne makes the following point:&nbsp;&nbsp; Which do you
think is worse:
<UL>
<LI>
distortion only in band 9?&nbsp;&nbsp; (1.9-2.2kHz)&nbsp;&nbsp; (over =
1)</LI>

<LI>
distortion in band 0 (0-172Hz) and band 20 (13-16kHz)&nbsp; (over = 2)</LI>
</UL>
The outer_loop() described above will choose the over=1 as the best quantization.
