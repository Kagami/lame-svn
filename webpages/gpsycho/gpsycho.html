<p>GPSYCHO is an open source psycho-acoustic and noise shaping model for
ISO based MP3 encoders.&nbsp; GPSYCHO fixes some substantial bugs in the
ISO demonstration source psycho-acoustic model (ISO psy-model). In addition,&nbsp;
GPSYCHO adds mid/side stereo, real bit reservoir control, much improved
critical band bit allocation routines, variable bit rate (optional) and
very good pre-echo control.&nbsp; At 128kbs, the quality is significantly
better than that produced by the ISO psy-model (as found in almost all
other free encoders).&nbsp; An example of these improvements is shown in
<a href="../screenshots/screenshots.html">Screenshots</a>
.&nbsp; GPSYCHO is close to the quality of the FhG encoder, but there is
still room for improvement.&nbsp; Read on if you want to help!
<p>As this code is released under the GPL, it can only be used in other
GPL'd&nbsp; projects.&nbsp; I would also encourage others to help improve
GPSYCHO.&nbsp; Some things that would help:
<ul>
<li>
Find (and send me) samples where your favorite encoder does a better job
than GPSYCHO.</li>

<li>
Run your own listening tests and try tuning some of the algorithms below.&nbsp;
Most have parameters that are set via trial and error.</li>

<li>
Try out new algorithms!</li>
</ul>

<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%">New Features (which may need some tuning):</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Bit allocation outer loop improved based on ideas in an MPEG2 J. Audio
Eng. Soc. 1997 paper.&nbsp; The ISO demonstration source outer loop can
produce some very poor quality frames in certain situations.</li>

<li>
VBR (variable bit rate) is now working!&nbsp;&nbsp; See the VBR link above
for details.</li>

<li>
MS_STEREO switch.&nbsp; ISO formula is primitive.&nbsp; I use a switch
described <a href="ms_stereo.html">here.</a></li>

<li>
MS_STEREO ISO sparsing&nbsp; formula does not work.&nbsp; It will remove
95% of the side channel coefficients.&nbsp; GPSYCHO does not sparse the
side channel at all, but allocate less bits for encoding.&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin
Weghofer &lt;e9427483@student.tuwien.ac.at>&nbsp; has a coder which does
effectively use side channel sparsing, but the algorithm does not work
will with the LAME quantization procedure.&nbsp; This is an area that needs
further work.</li>

<li>
MS_STEREO now uses ideas in a Johnson ICASSP 1992 paper to compute true
Mid and Side thresholds which compensate for stereo de-masking.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Similar to that used in PAC and AAC.</li>

<li>
Bit reservoir use.&nbsp; Again the ISO formula performs poorly.&nbsp; At
128kbs,&nbsp; it always thinks it needs to drain the reservoir, and thus
the reservoir can never build up.&nbsp; It will also use up all the bits
for the left channel before even looking at the right channel.</li>

<li>
Mid/Side bit allocation.&nbsp; GPSYCHO allocate bits based on the differences
between left and right masking thresholds.&nbsp; Anyone have a better idea?</li>

<li>
lowpass filtering based on the compression ratio.&nbsp; For high compression
ratios, low pass filtering will improve the results.&nbsp; The exact amount
of filtering needed depends on the music and personal preferences - the
formula to decide how much lowpass filtering to use may need some tuning.&nbsp;
At 256kbs, no filterings is done.&nbsp; At 128kbs, the lowpass filter is
around 15.5khz.</li>

<li>
Improved shortblock switching.&nbsp; It is now based on surges in PE or
large fluctuations in energy within a single granule.&nbsp; These improvements
trigger some critical window switching that LAME used to miss.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Features to try out:</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Add a high-pass filter.&nbsp; 20Hz?</li>

<li>
Shorter FFT for the long block noise threshold calculation.&nbsp; A 768
FFT centered over the 576 sample granule would be more accurate for the
high frequency energies than the 1024 FFT.&nbsp;&nbsp; This should also
improve the perceptual entropy (pe) calculation since there will be less
interference from data outside the granule.&nbsp; Another advantage might
be for the applaud.wav test - see the&nbsp; <a href="quality.html">Quality</a>
section for details.&nbsp; It will of course make the low frequency energy
estimates less accurate.</li>

<li>
subblock_gain.&nbsp; This seems to be important.&nbsp; FhG uses it for
most short blocks.&nbsp; LAME and other dist10 based codes do not make
any use of this.&nbsp;&nbsp; VBR modes will use subblock gain.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Things we've learned from analyzing FhG (mp3enc3.1) produced .mp3 frames:</h3>

<ul>
<li>
FhG uses mixed_blocks only if specified as an option.</li>

<li>
FhG uses intensity stereo only at lower bitrates.</li>

<li>
FhG does not seem to use&nbsp; scsfi&lt;>0</li>

<li>
Removes data in scalefactor band 21 at 128kbs.</li>

<li>
Almost always uses ms_stereo.&nbsp; Does not use ISO formula for ms_stereo
switching.</li>

<li>
More sophisticated mid/side bit allocation.</li>

<li>
Excellent short block detection.</li>

<li>
Good bit reservoir use.&nbsp; Not totally based on pe, since they often
allocate extra bits to long blocks.</li>
</ul>
