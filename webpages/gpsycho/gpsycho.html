<P>GPSYCHO is an open source psycho-acoustic and noise shaping model for
ISO based MP3 encoders.&nbsp; GPSYCHO fixes some substantial bugs in the
ISO demonstration source psycho-acoustic model (ISO psy-model). In addition,&nbsp;
GPSYCHO adds mid/side stereo, real bit reservoir control, much improved
critical band bit allocation routines, variable bit rate (optional) and
very good pre-echo control.&nbsp; At 128kbs, the quality is significantly
better than that produced by the ISO psy-model (as found in almost all
other free encoders).&nbsp; An example of these improvements is shown in
<A HREF="../screenshots/screenshots.html">Screenshots</A>
.&nbsp; GPSYCHO is close to the quality of the FhG encoder, but there is
still room for improvement.&nbsp; Read on if you want to help!
<P>As this code is released under the GPL, it can only be used in other
GPL'd&nbsp; projects.&nbsp; I would also encourage others to help improve
GPSYCHO.&nbsp; Some things that would help:
<UL>
<LI>
Find (and send me) samples where your favorite encoder does a better job
than GPSYCHO.</LI>

<LI>
Run your own listening tests and try tuning some of the algorithms below.&nbsp;
Most have parameters that are set via trial and error.</LI>

<LI>
Try out new algorithms!</LI>

<H3>

<HR WIDTH="100%">New Features (which may need some tuning):</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Bit allocation outer loop improved based on ideas in an MPEG2 J. Audio
Eng. Soc. 1997 paper.&nbsp; The ISO demonstration source outer loop can
produce some very poor quality frames in certain situations.</LI>

<LI>
VBR (variable bit rate) is now working!&nbsp;&nbsp; See the VBR link above
for details.</LI>

<LI>
MS_STEREO switch.&nbsp; ISO formula is primitive.&nbsp; I use a switch
described <A HREF="ms_stereo.html">here.</A></LI>

<LI>
MS_STEREO ISO sparsing&nbsp; formula does not work.&nbsp; It will remove
95% of the side channel coefficients.&nbsp; I don't sparse the side channel
at all, but allocate less bits for encoding.&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin Weghofer
&lt;e9427483@student.tuwien.ac.at>&nbsp; has a coder which does effectively
use side channel sparsing, but the algorithm does not work will with the
LAME quantization procedure.&nbsp; This is an area that needs further work.</LI>

<LI>
MS_STEREO now uses ideas in a Johnson ICASSP 1992 paper to compute true
Mid and Side thresholds which compensate for stereo de-masking.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is used in PAC and AAC.</LI>

<LI>
Bit reservoir use.&nbsp; Again the ISO formula performs poorly.&nbsp; At
128kbs,&nbsp; it always thinks it needs to drain the reservoir, and thus
the reservoir can never build up.&nbsp; It will also use up all the bits
for the left channel before even looking at the right channel.&nbsp; I
put in a kludged up formula that seems to work ok, but could use some tuning.</LI>

<LI>
Mid/Side bit allocation.&nbsp; I allocate bits based on the differences
between left and right masking thresholds.&nbsp; Anyone have a better idea?</LI>

<LI>
Remove data in scalefactor band 21 when encoding at 128kbs or less.&nbsp;
This was done because FhG also does it (you can see this by running the
graphical frame analyzer).&nbsp; It amounts to a 16kHz low-pass filter
and makes a few more bits available for more important information.&nbsp;
If it offends you, you probably should not be encoding at 128kbs in the
first place!&nbsp; Try 160kbs.&nbsp; At 128kbs, more often than not the
psy-model will remove these frequencies even without this mod.</LI>

<LI>
Improved shortblock switching.&nbsp; It is now based on surges in PE or
large fluctuations in energy within a single granule.&nbsp; These improvements
trigger some critical window switching that LAME used to miss.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Features to try out:</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Add a high-pass filter.&nbsp; 20Hz?</LI>

<LI>
Shorter FFT for the long block noise threshold calculation.&nbsp; A 768
FFT centered over the 576 sample granule would be more accurate for the
high frequency energies than the 1024 FFT.&nbsp;&nbsp; This should also
improve the perceptual entropy (pe) calculation since there will be less
interference from data outside the granule.&nbsp; Another advantage might
be for the applaud.wav test - see the&nbsp; <A HREF="quality.html">Quality</A>
section for details.&nbsp; It will of course make the low frequency energy
estimates less accurate.</LI>

<LI>
subblock_gain.&nbsp; This seems to be important.&nbsp; FhG uses it for
most short blocks.&nbsp; LAME and other dist10 based codes do not make
any use of this.&nbsp; One subblock gain algorithm (LAME 3.21) is enabled
with -Z.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Things I've learned from analyzing FhG produced .mp3 frames (layer 3, 128kbs):</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
I've never seen FhG use mixed_blocks</LI>

<LI>
I've never seen FhG use intensity stereo</LI>

<LI>
I've never seen FhG use scsfi&lt;>0</LI>

<LI>
Removes data in scalefactor band 21 at 128kbs.</LI>

<LI>
Almost always uses ms_stereo.&nbsp; Does not use ISO formula for ms_stereo
switching.</LI>

<LI>
More sophisticated mid/side bit allocation.</LI>

<LI>
Excellent short block detection.&nbsp; How do they do this?&nbsp; They
can't be using the ISO pe formula.</LI>

<LI>
Good bit reservoir use.&nbsp; Not totally based on pe, since they often
allocate extra bits to long blocks.</LI>

<LI>
Does not produce variable bit rate frames.</LI>
