<p>ABR&nbsp;mode&nbsp; is like CBR, but with an unlimited bit reservoir.&nbsp;
When using ABR,&nbsp; GPSYCHO&nbsp;will use the CBR algorithm to compute
the number of bits needed to encode each frame.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the number
of bits is greater than the target bitrate, the CBR algorithm has to use
bits from the bit reservoir, and we just have to hope that the bitreservoir
has enought bits!
<p>With ABR, GPSYCHO&nbsp;does not rely on the bit reservoir at all, but
each frame just uses the smallest possible bitrate which can encode the
frame with the desired number of bits.
<p>The difference between ABR&nbsp;and true VBR is in how the desired number
of bits is chosen.&nbsp; The true VBR&nbsp;mode determines the number of
bits based on the quantization noise.&nbsp; VBR figures out how many bits
are needed so that the quantization noise is less than the allowed masking.
<p>ABR mode uses the CBR&nbsp;formula to determine the desired number of
bits.&nbsp; This formulas is based on the perceptual entropy, which is
a rough measure of how difficult the frame is to encode.
