MP3x Screenshots</H1></CENTER>

<P><BR>MP3x is an graphical frame analyzer for both MP3 and unencoded audio
files.&nbsp; It displays frame header information, original and decoded
pcm data, MDCT spectrum, distortion, allowable distortion and other psycho-acoustic
information.&nbsp; MP3x is distributed with the LAME source code - see
the file INSTALL for information about compiling MP3x.
<P>The following screenshots are from MP3x analyzing the file
<A HREF="http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/~bosse/">castanets.wav</A>,
or in the case of the FhG encoder and Mpecker,&nbsp; the frame analyzer
was run directly on the castanets.mp3 file produced by these encoders.

<LI>
Analysis with mp3x using the GPSYCHO psycho-acoustic model.</LI>

<LI>
GPSYCHO almost completely removes the pre-echo effect in both granules.</LI>

<LI>
GPSYCHO makes good use of the bit reservoir - 1708 bits are used to code
the mid channel for this granule, and 956 for the side channel.</LI>

<LI>
Unencoded MDCT coefficients are shown (the display can be toggled between
encoded and unencoded.)</LI>

<A HREF="fhg.gif">Castanets.mp3 from FhG MP3Encoder</A></H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Analysis of an FhG encoded .mp3 file with mp3x. Since we are analyzing
an already encoded file, there is no psycho-acoustic information nor can
the original .wav file data or original MDCT coefficients be plotted.</LI>

<LI>
Note the almost complete lack of pre-echo.</LI>

<LI>
MP3Encoder&nbsp; is making use of MS_STEREO and has almost doubled the
number of bits used to encode the granule with the sharp attack.</LI>

<LI>
The attack occurs in frame 39 instead of frame 38 as it does in the other
screenshots.&nbsp; This is because the FhG encoder has an extra filter
bank delay as compared to the ISO encoder (perhaps coming from a high-pass
filter?).&nbsp; I added padding to the castanets.wav to make this delay
exactly one frame.</LI>

&nbsp;<A HREF="iso.gif">Castanets.wav using ISO psy-model</A></H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Analysis with mp3x using the original ISO psycho-acoustic model.</LI>

<LI>
Most freely available encoders will produce identical results (LAME 2.1,
8hz-mp3, BlaceEnc, CDex with ISO .dll)</LI>

<LI>
Note the pre-echo introduced throughout the entire frame, and the fact
that the algorithm failed to switch to short blocks for the sharp attack
of the castanets.&nbsp; It will switch on the next frame, one granule too
late.</LI>

<LI>
Only&nbsp; 771 bits is used to encode this granule - it is not taking bits
from the bit reservoir, nor is it exploting extra bits from mid/side stereo.</LI>

<LI>
Unencoded&nbsp; MDCT coefficients are shown (the display can be toggled
between encoded and unencoded.)</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
&nbsp;<A HREF="mpecker.gif">Castanets.wav using MPECKER</A></H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Analysis with mp3x of MPECKER encoded castanests.mp3.&nbsp; Since we are
analyzing an already encoded file, there is no psycho-acoustic information,
nor can the original .wav data or original MDCT coefficients be plotted.</LI>

<LI>
Mpecker has many strenghts, but does not do well with&nbsp; pre-echo control.
It does not switch to short blocks, nor does it make any use of the bit
reservoir.&nbsp;&nbsp; Future versions may overcome this with variable
bit rate.</LI>

<LI>
Mpecker does make use of mid/side stereo, allocating 896 bits for the midchannel
of this granule and 688 for the side channel.mid/side stereo.</LI>
