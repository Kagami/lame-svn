&nbsp; The Winamp/100Hz&nbsp; Decoding Bug</h1></center>

<h3>
UPDATE 10/2/00:&nbsp; Winamp Bug Fixed!</h3>
This probably shouldn't be called a Winamp bug or a <a href="http://www.mp3dev.org">LAME</a>
bug, but instead a flaw in the&nbsp; MP3 ISO specification.
<p>It was caused by assuming that the Huffman "big_values" data is at most
8191 (2^13 -1). 13 bits are used to encode these numbers, but in some cases
during decoding you need to add 15 to the result.&nbsp; Thus the effective
range is 0 through
<br>8206.&nbsp; However, the ISO MP3 spec says that the maximum value should
be 8191, and it is not clear if they are refering to the maximum value
before or after adding the 15, and the ISO demonstration source (dist10)
uses values up to 8206.&nbsp;&nbsp; Imposing a maximum value of 8191 is
a completely unneeded restriction which results in a (very tiny) loss of
quality.
<p>The 8191/8206 issue was first described by Rob Leslie, author of the
<a href="http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/mpeg/">MAD
decoder</a>. It was placed on the todo list&nbsp; to decide if LAME should
use values up to 8206 or limit them to 8191.&nbsp; It&nbsp; took several
months for us to realize that this issue was triggering the "Winamp bug".
<p>Developers for Winamp and Sonique have already produced&nbsp; versions
of their software which can decode 100only.mp3.&nbsp; So this should be
fixed in the releases dated after 10/2/00.
<p>LAME 3.88 will either be set to not encode big_values greater than 8191,
or this limit will be enforced if the&nbsp; "--strictly-enforce-ISO" option
is used.

<p><a href="../index.html">The LAME project&nbsp;</a> often receives reports
of this bug.&nbsp; The problem seems to be that the LAME produced mp3 files
of simple harmonics like the pure 100Hz tone shown below is decoded incorrectly
with Winamp/Nitrane.&nbsp; Testing shows that this is in fact not a bug
in the LAME produced mp3 file, but a bug in the Nitrane decoding engine
used by Winamp.
<p>The followin players will decode the MP3 file with no problems:&nbsp;
mpg123, xmms, freeamp (Xing engine),&nbsp; musicmatch&nbsp; jukebox, windows
media player, sonique 1.30.4, UltraPlayer 1.0.
<p>More evidence of bugs in Nitrane can be found in <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/mp3encoder@geek.rcc.se/msg02361.html">Matthew
Loyd's post in the mp3encoder mailing list.</a>
<p>Naoki Shibata has also documented some bugs in Nitrane, and has produced
a Winamp decoder plugin based on mpg123.&nbsp; This plugin replaces Nitrane.&nbsp;&nbsp;
See <a href="http://www.geocities.co.jp/Technopolis/9674/in_mpg123.html">Naoki's&nbsp;
web site.</a>
<p>Even more MP3 decoder bugs can be found at&nbsp; <a href="http://players.shoutclub.net/wavcompare/">MP3
Player Quality Comparson Site.</a>&nbsp; and <a href="http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~djmrob/mp3decoders/">MP3
decoder tests.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both sites document severe flaws
in several popular decoders.
<p>Test samples:
<p><a href="100only.wav">100only.wav</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A&nbsp; pure 100 Hz sine wave
<br><a href="100only.mp3">100only.mp3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Encoded with "lame -h"
<p><a href="sweep.wav">sweep.wav&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Here are some illustrations showing&nbsp; two Nitrane bugs when decoding
the 100only.mp3 file.<br>
(Similar problems show up with sweep.mp3).&nbsp;<br>

Periodice drop out.&nbsp; This dropout occurs peiodically in the Nitrane
decoded file (about once per second)</h3>
Here is a picture of the wav form around sample 2500, of the Nitrane decoded
100only.mp3:

<p>And here is the same picture, only using mpg123 to decode the mp3 file:
<br>(similar correct results are obtained with other decoders such as MusicMatch
and Sonique)

<p>Here is the .wav file produced by Nitrane, from 100only.mp3, at time
0:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (note that all encoders and decoders introduce a delay,
in this case around&nbsp; 1000 samples)
