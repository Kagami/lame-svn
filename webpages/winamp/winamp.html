&nbsp; The Winamp&nbsp; Decoding Bug</h1></center>

<h3>
This bug is in Winamp 2.62 (latest version as of 5/1/00) and earlier versions.</h3>
Update 6/9/00:&nbsp; Winamp 2.64 has the same bugs.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a href="../index.html">The LAME project </a>receives reports of this
bug, in various forms, about once a week.&nbsp; The problem seems to be
that the LAME produced mp3 files of simple harmonics like the pure 100Hz
tone shown below is decoded incorrectly with Winamp/Nitrane.&nbsp; Testing
shows that this is in fact not a bug in the LAME produced mp3 file, but
a bug in the Nitrane decoding engine used by Winamp.
<p>The followin players will decode the MP3 file with no problems:&nbsp;
mpg123, xmms, freeamp (Xing engine),&nbsp; musicmatch&nbsp; jukebox, windows
media player, sonique 1.30.4, UltraPlayer 1.0.
<p>More evidence of bugs in Nitrane can be found in <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/mp3encoder@geek.rcc.se/msg02361.html">Matthew
Loyd's post in the mp3encoder mailing list.</a>
<p>Naoki Shibata has also documented some bugs in Nitrane, and has produced
a Winamp decoder plugin based on mpg123.&nbsp; This plugin replaces Nitrane.&nbsp;&nbsp;
See <a href="http://www.geocities.co.jp/Technopolis/9674/in_mpg123.html">Naoki's&nbsp;
web site.</a>
<p>Even more documentation of winamp bugs can be found at this <a href="http://players.shoutclub.net/wavcompare/">MP3
Player Quality Comparson Site.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; They have doecumented severe
flaws in several popular decoders.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>Test samples:
<p><a href="100only.wav">100only.wav</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A&nbsp; pure 100 Hz sine wave
<br><a href="100only.mp3">100only.mp3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Encoded with "lame -h"
<p><a href="sweep.wav">sweep.wav&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A sine wav sweep from 20Hz-20,000Hz
<br><a href="sweep.mp3">sweep.mp3&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Encoded with "lame -h"

<br>
Here are some illustrations showing&nbsp; two Nitrane bugs when decoding
the 100only.mp3 file.<br>
(Similar problems show up with sweep.mp3).&nbsp;<br>

<h3>
Periodice drop out.&nbsp; This dropout occurs peiodically in the Nitrane
decoded file (about once per second)</h3>
Here is a picture of the wav form around sample 2500, of the Nitrane decoded
100only.mp3:

<p>And here is the same picture, only using mpg123 to decode the mp3 file:
<br>(similar correct results are obtained with other decoders such as MusicMatch
and Sonique)

Nitrane glitch at beginning of file:</h3>
Here is the original .wav file, starting at time=0s:
<br><img SRC="100only.time0.gif" >
<p>Here is the .wav file produced by Nitrane, from 100only.mp3, at time
0:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (note that all encoders and decoders introduce a delay,
in this case around&nbsp; 1000 samples)

<p>And here is the .wav file produced my mpg123, from 100only.mp3, at time
0.
