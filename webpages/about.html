<p>Following the great history of GNU naming, LAME originally stood for LAME Ain't 
an Mp3 Encoder. LAME started life as a GPL'd patch against the dist10 ISO demonstration 
source, and thus was incapable of producing an mp3 stream or even being compiled 
by itself. But in May 2000, the last remnants of the ISO source code were replaced, 
and now LAME is the source code for a fully LGPL'd MP3 encoder, with speed and 
quality to rival all commercial competitors.</p>
<p>LAME is an educational tool to be used for learning about MP3 encoding. The 
  goal of the LAME project is to use the open source model to improve the psycho 
  acoustics, noise shaping and speed of MP3. LAME is not for everyone - it is 
  distributed as source code only and requires the ability to use a C compiler. 
  However, many popular ripping and encoding programs include the LAME encoding 
  engine, see: Software which uses LAME.</p>
