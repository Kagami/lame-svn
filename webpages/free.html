Based on what I've learned working with <A HREF="index.html">LAME</A> and
<A HREF="gpsycho/gpsycho.html">GPSYCHO</A>,
I believe it would not be too difficult to develop an independent audio
codec of slightly better quality than LAME, (and thus comparible to the
best commercial MP3 codecs).&nbsp; Yes, it wont be as good as AAC,&nbsp;
but think of this:&nbsp; how many people would use a proprietary compression
code which was slightly better than gzip?
<P>The following is an outline of such an audio codec.&nbsp; It is based
on general published ideas which form the basis of several encoders (MP3,
MPEG4-AAC, AT&amp;T PAC).&nbsp;&nbsp; It includes most of the ideas that
were used by the MP3 format, but removes many of the components in MP3
which are inherited from layer I and layer II.&nbsp; I have also added
some newer ideas that were utilized by AAC and PAC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some
of the more sophisticated ideas such as temporal noise shaping and predictive
coding are not included.
<P>The problem with all of this:&nbsp; many of these fundamental ideas
are patented in countries which allow patents on algorithms.&nbsp; There
is still a difference between ideas and algorithms, so it may be possible
to implement this codec using different algorithms for the same ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It will require a significant amount of legal work to make this determination.&nbsp;
If your beliefs do not coincide with the patent holder's beliefs, you could
be sued and the courts will decide.&nbsp; If you dont have the money for
such a law suit, then that is the end of the project!
<P>Just a cursiory patent search will yield dozens of patents on every
aspect of audio compression.&nbsp; Below I have referenced some of these
patents along with my uninformed interpretation of what they claim.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
Frame/Window types</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
1024 and 128 (for pre-echo) sample windows.&nbsp; MP3 uses 576 &amp; 192
sample windows.&nbsp; AAC uses 1024 and 128 sample windows.&nbsp; (Brandenburg
&amp; Stoll 1994, Bosi et al. 1997 in <A HREF="refs.html">References</A>)</LI>

<LI>
Spectral coefficients computed from overlapping MDCT coefficients.&nbsp;
(lossless).&nbsp;&nbsp; MP3 and AAC apply the MDCT only after first splitting
the signal into frequency bands with&nbsp; windowed filterbanks.</LI>

<LI>
pre-echo detection from the <A HREF="gpsycho/gpsycho.html">GPSYCHO</A>
algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp; The GPSYCHO pre-echo detection algorithm is truely
original, although it is such a simple concept that I'm sure someone has
patented it.</LI>
</UL>
The very concept of using spectral transforms applied to frames of PCM
samples seems to be patented&nbsp; (US5579430).&nbsp;&nbsp; But I believe
spectral transforms (or filterbanks) must be used because psycho acoustic
information is given in terms of spectral coefficients (the frequency domain).&nbsp;
The majority of audio compression comes from allocating bits between different
frequency bands based on psycho acoustic information.
<P>The concept of window switching to reduce pre-echo effects is patented
in US5285498.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
Critical Bands</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Group coefficients in critical bands.&nbsp; MP3 uses 21 for long windows,
12 for short.&nbsp; AAC uses 49 for long windows, 14 for short.</LI>

<LI>
Allow option of <A HREF="gpsycho/ms_stereo.html">mid/side encoding </A>for
each critical band.&nbsp;&nbsp; MP3 does not allow mid/side encoding on
a band by band basis.&nbsp; AT&amp;T PAC does.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Johnston &amp;
Ferrera 1992&nbsp; <A HREF="refs.html">References)</A></LI>
</UL>
Critical bands are a way to group frequency bands which better mimics the
response of the human ear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept is old, but there
may be patents on the use of critical bands for audio compression.&nbsp;
The concept of mid/side encoding is patented in US5481614.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
Quantization of MDCT coefficients</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Associated to each critical band is a scale factor.&nbsp; The larger the
scale factor, the more bits allocated to this critical bands.</LI>

<LI>
Truncate MDCT coefficients *scalefactor to integers.&nbsp; This is all
that is meant by Quantization.</LI>

<LI>
Choose scale factors so quantization distortion in each critical band is
less than the masking computed by the psycho-acoustic model.</LI>

<LI>
If more compression is desired (with some distortion) choose scale factors
with<A HREF="gpsycho/outer_loop.html"> GPSYCHO algorithm.</A>&nbsp; Compression
can be controlled to produce a given bitrate, or given quality.</LI>
</UL>
The use of scale factors to control the allocation of bits between scale
factor bands is patented.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even worse, just the concept of allocating
bits among critical bands based on any set of external requirements is
patented.&nbsp; (US5579430)
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
Lossless compression of quantized MDCT coefficients</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Some type of lossless compression and encoding of quantized data.&nbsp;&nbsp;
MP3 uses Huffman coding with precomputed tables each assigned a unique
code.</LI>
</UL>
The type of Huffman coding used in MP3 is patented (US5579430).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Are there other types of Huffman coding which we could use?&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is the concept of precomputed tables patentable?&nbsp; Or are just the
tables themselves patented?&nbsp; A version of the algorith in gzip, optimized
for audio frames would probably be the best just.
<BR>But just the very fact of using optimized encoding is claimed to be
patented!&nbsp; (US5579430).
<H3>
Psycho-acoustic model (output used during quantization step)</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Masking given by a linear function expressed in critical bands</LI>

<LI>
Strength of masking given from tonality of signal</LI>

<LI>
Tonality estimated by a measure of the predictability of the signal.</LI>

<LI>
Johnson (1988) and Brandenburg &amp; Johnston (1990)&nbsp; <A HREF="refs.html">References</A></LI>
</UL>
The algebraic formulas for these quantities are in the published literature.&nbsp;
The tonality formula is patented in US5040217.
